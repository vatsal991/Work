// algorithm for addition of two numbers

step 1: input two numbers a and b,
step 2: do addition of that two numbers,
step 3 : store that addition in new variable c,
step 4 : return or print new variable c.


// Area of circle

step 1: get input of radius od circle and store in r,
step 2: and assign value of pi=3.14 (For A = pi x r x r),
step 3 : so do multiplication of r x r x pi amd store result in A,
step 4 : return or print new variable A.

// sum of all the even numbers

step 1: get in n and initiate variable sum(n is number that we want to do loop),
step 2: run for loop with terminal condition less then equal to n,
step 3: and check if i/2=0 then do addition of that i with sum,
step 4: return or print value of sum.
